Modelling the ‘Black Death’ if it were to occur in Modern Day

*Why I chose this topic*

Having completed my BSc in Environmental Hazards and Disaster Management in 2017 I began working in the GIS industry as this was the 
aspect I most enjoyed from my undergraduate degree. 
Since then, I have  moved away from the GIS sector and have been working as an Emergency Planning Officer for the past two years.

One of the disaster and emergency areas I find most interesting is pandemic diseases. This is due to its global implication and rapid ability to affect a huge population. Whilst flooding, earthquakes and volcanic eruptions can be devestating, they typically affect a single location or region, not the entire world. 
On top of this, whilst pandemic diseases have sat towards the top of the [National Risk Register](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/61934/national_risk_register.pdf) for many years, they are nearly impossible to predict.

It is this, short notice global impact that I find interesting, particularly when the Risk Register shows that pandemics are high risk yet governments around the world rarely have the provisions in place to deal with the event.

This is the reason why I chose to research one of the most notable pandemic diseases outbreaks in history, 'The Black Death', otherwise known as an outbreak of Bubonic Plague. At the time this disease decimated Europe's Population and given the increased ease and speed of travel both nationally and internationally I was keen to discover how a disease of this nature would impact todays population.
