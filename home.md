Welcome to my University of Leeds GEOG5990M Programming for Spatial Analysts: Core Skills Submission page.

*About this Module*

This is the final module of my second year in MSc GIS at the University of Leeds. 
I have found this module to be the hardest so far as I found coding to be more complex than anticipated.
I have, however, developed some entry level skills in Python programming and now feel confident enough to carry out basic 
python queries, read python files and code small python applications. 
I will be leaving anything more complex to someone more experienced though!

*About Me*

Having completed my BSc in Environmental Hazards and Disaster Management in 2017 I began working in the GIS industry as this was the 
aspect I most enjoyed from my undergraduate degree. 
I had worked in the GIS sector for a year when in 2018 I began my MSc in GIS so I could advance in the GIS field. 
Since then, I have  moved away from the GIS sector and have been working as an Emergency Planning Officer for the past year, 
however I plan to incorperate GIS into this role by producing hazard and emergency response maps for my team.
