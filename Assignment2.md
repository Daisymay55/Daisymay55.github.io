*Assignment 2 - Earthquake Mapping*

*Assignment Details*

For this module I created an earthquake map which shows the 2000 largest earthquakes by magnitude, from 01/01/1900 to 01/01/2020, for across the globe. 

The earthquakes are colour coded by magnitude and range from Magnitude 6.0 upwards.
Each earthquake marker is clickable to show additional information as a pop-up, the markers have also been set with a transparency so any overlapping points can be seen. 

The original earthquake file needed amendments in order to style the pop-ups. A selection of information was taken from the earthquake file as not all the data needed to be displayed. It was decided to show the location name, date and magnitude of the earthquakes. The location name had the first letter of each word capitlised in order to make it more aesthetically pleasing. The date field had the time aspect removed as it was deemed unnecessary to show the precise seconds of an earthquake that occured a century ago, I would have liked to of reordered the date field so it read day-month-year rather than year-day-month however I was unable to achieve this. Finally the precise magnitude was included as it was deemed useful for the user to know the exact magnitude of each earthquake after they had chosen a magnitude range that was of interest to them. 

The map also contains a terrain baselayer and a population overlay which shows each country colour coded by population. It was decided it may be useful to include the population for each country as this could be used in combination with the earthquake data to gauge the risk to each country. 

The map is designed so that each layer can be turned on/off indivdually so the map output can be tailored to the users needs.
