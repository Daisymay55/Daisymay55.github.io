*Assignment 2 - Earthquake Mapping*

*Assignment Details*

For this module I created an earthquake map which shows the 2000 largest earthquakes by magnitude, from 01/01/1900 to 01/01/2020, for across the globe. 
The earthquakes are colour coded by magnitude and range from Magnitude 6.0 upwards.
Each earthquake marker is clickable to show additional information as a pop-up, the markers have also been set with a transparency so any overlapping points can be seen. 
The map also contains a terrain baselayer and a population overlay which shows each country colour coded by population.

The map is designed so that each layer can be turned on/off indivdually so the map output can be tailored to the users needs.
