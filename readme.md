Additional information required to run the file along with the expected outcome is shown below.

*Files required*

- ABMUnit7.py
- agentframework.py
- in.txt

*Software required*

- A python program - This application was created in Spyder but should run in any python program

* How to run the application*

- save the datafiles required into a directory,
- open a python software and load the ABMUnit7.py file. 
- click run within the python software to load the animated graph and any related text outputs
- N.B. graph and text outputs may load in separate windows dependant on which python software is used

*Expected output*

- the animated model will generate and move the agents around the map for 500 iterations whilst eating the old data 
  and sharing the new data with the other agents. 
- the sharing of data will prevent the agents from colliding and if they become in close proximity of each other or 
  the edge of the map they will automatically move away.
- a text output will also be generated showing the starting coordinates for a random agent, it then shows the new coordinates for that agent after one move. This also proves that the agents are moving around at random as each time the application is run different coordinates will be given. 

*Licences*
- Data was supplied by University of Leeds as part of the GEOG5990M Programming for Spatial Analysts: Core Skills module.
